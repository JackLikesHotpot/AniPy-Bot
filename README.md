# AniPy Bot
A Discord bot that uses the AniList GraphQL API, coded in Python. 
You can search for anime/manga titles, users, reverse image anime pictures, and more.

# Disclaimer
Just pushed up a change (05/01/22) to fix a problem caused by tracemoepy at v4.1.
**Don't think I plan to return to this project again.** Code is somewhat poor and only reflective of my skills in Aug 2020.

# Features:
* Search anime by title/ID
* Search manga by title/ID
* Reverse image search anime by image link

* Display a user's favourites
* Display the top 5 anime of a studio
